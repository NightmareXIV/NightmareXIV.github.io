# Development Times and Pauses
## Development Times
It is important to understand that due to the unpredictable nature of plugin development, it is not possible to guarantee exact development time. 

However, the general rule is 1 week per every 100 USD evaluated during normal commission status and is rarely exceeded. 

## Intermediate Results
During development, you will periodically receive intermediate results consisting of a plugin with partial functionality. You can choose to test them immediately or wait for the full release.

## Expected Development Pauses
Development is automatically paused and development times are automatically extended when these events occur:
- **Game servers are not accessible** (due to maintenance or other reasons). Development will resume the day after the game servers becomes accessible.
- **Release version of Dalamud is not available.** Development will resume the day after the release version becomes available.
- **8-player Savage raid release.** Development will be paused for 7 days after the Savage raid release. Chaotic, Foray, Criterion raids will not cause this pause.
- **Ultimate raid release.** Development will be paused for 30 days after the release of the ultimate raid.

Listed times and pauses apply only to new plugins or new features. Times and pauses regarding existing plugin updates are outlined in the Update Policy section.

## Unexpected Development Pauses
In case of natural disasters, illness, internet or PC problems, an unexpected pause may occur. In this case, I will provide some form of compensation, such as an extended free update period or free additional features.

## Testing
While I will do as much testing as possible, it is ultimately up to you to test your plugin. All discovered bugs will be fixed for free.
