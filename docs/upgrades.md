# Plugin Upgrades
If you have previously commissioned a pluging from NightmareXIV before, you may commission additional upgrades for it.

This type of commission is possible even if the commission status is set to Closed. However, it will not bypass development pauses.
{: .important }

In general, there is no difference compared to a process to commission a new plugin, except:
- There is no minimum price, other than the one imposed by the choice of the payment system.

Commissioning an upgrade will refresh Free Update Period to 1 year after upgrade will be completed.
