# Feature Requests
You also may commission a feature request towards a different plugin that you have not previously commissioned. 

Feature request must fit into targeted plugin's intended functions.
{: .warning }

In general, there is no difference compared to a process to commission a new plugin, except:
- If you commission a feature request for the NightmareXIV plugin, there is no minimum price, except for the one imposed by the choice of payment system (otherwise the standard minimum commission price applies);
- There will be no free update period;
- If you submit a feature request for the plugin that is not owned by NightmareXIV, keep in mind that there is no guarantee that such a feature request will be accepted by the owner of the plugin. You will have to ask the plugin owner yourself if they are willing to accept it, I will not be able to do that.
