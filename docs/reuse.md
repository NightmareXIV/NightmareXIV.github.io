# Code Reuse Policy

It is up to you to confirm that the plugin you wish to commission does not already exist. While I will do my best to inform you of any existing public plugins that may meet your needs, I cannot guarantee that such plugins do not exist at the time of your request.
{: .warning }

If someone else commissions the same plugin that you previously commissioned, a different plugin will be developed for them. They will not receive the plugin that you have commissioned.

The reverse is also true: if you commission the previously commissioned plugin, a new plugin will be developed from scratch for you. Please note that I will not provide any information about whether a specific plugin has been commissioned before.

If you want access to a plugin that was commissioned by someone else, you will need to contact the client who commissioned the plugin in question. I will not be able to contact them on your behalf, or give you their contact information, unless they have given me explicit permission to do so.
