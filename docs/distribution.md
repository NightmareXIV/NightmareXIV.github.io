- Ask me to publish it in the NightmareXIV repository;
- Publish it to your own plugin repository;
- Distribute it privately to selected people;
- Keep it to yourself.

## Request to publish plugin to official Dalamud repository
- Not all plugins can be published to the official Dalamud repository by me, even if they meet the official repository rules. If this is important to you, please ask me in advance;
- Plugin must comply with official repository rules;
- Plugin must not repeat functions of other plugins that are part of the official Dalamud repository;
- Even if the plugin is submitted to the official repository, I do not guarantee that it will be published there;
