# Additional Services
When commissioning a plugin, you can request additional services from the following non-exhaustive list of free and paid options:

## Free Options
- **Code Obfuscation**. Protects your plugin's code from being uploaded to Github or similar sites and ownership of the plugin stolen. Only applicable if you do not plan to open the plugin's source code. 
- **Plugin icon**. I will select a suitable icon for your plugin from a free icon bank, if desired.

## Paid Options
- **Code documentation**. All functions will be documented, extensive comments will be added to the code. Mostly useful only if you plan to have an extra developer work on a plugin. Adds +50% to the cost of the plugin. 
- **Code style enforcement**. You can provide an .editorconfig file or simply express a desire to enforce a certain code style. Adds +200% to plugin cost.
- **CI/CD setup (Github only)**. Compilation via Github action, automatic creation of custom repo. Cost depends on desired automation, rarely more than 50 USD.

## Other Options
If you need some other option, simply include it into an initial request. This list serves just as an example of what is available.
