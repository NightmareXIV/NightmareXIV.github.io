# Refund Policy
## Refund request by customer
At any time, for any reason or no reason at all, you may request that development of the commissioned plugin is stopped and a refund is issued. In this case, a refund proportional to the remaining development progress will be issued. A full refund is only possible if development has not yet started.
The refund method depends on the payment system you used.
- **Cryptocurrency**: The refund will be sent to the same wallet or crypto exchange from which you transferred funds. A transaction fee will be deducted.
- **Other methods**: Monetary refunds will not be given, but a virtual balance will be created for you to spend on another commission or subscription level.

## Refund initiated by the developer
While I will do my best to make sure that an idea you want implemented is actually possible before I accept the commission, mistakes can happen. If it turns out that the development is impossible due to a technical limitation, you will receive a full refund.
- If you paid with **cryptocurrency**: The refund will be sent to the same wallet or crypto exchange from which you transferred the funds. Any transaction fees will be covered.
- If you paid with **other method**: If possible, the refund will be sent by the same method by which you sent the funds; however, if this is not possible, a different method may be requested. Any transaction fees will be covered.
