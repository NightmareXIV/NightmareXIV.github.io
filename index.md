Welcome to NightmareXIV! I'm happy to announce the official launch of plugin commissions. I've been doing them privately here and there, but now anyone can have a plugin made specifically for them - at an affordable price. 

Commissions are currently open and development times are normal.
{: .open }

Commissions are currently closed. Only update requests or additional features for previously commissioned plugins are available. In addition, development times will be extended due to increased load.

## Why choose NightmareXIV
- Development of plugins since 2020;
- Large number of plugins created (browse here);
- Not a single plugin has been retired (except those that have become obsolete);
- Fast updates and dedicated support server;
- Full transparency - no tricks, no hidden fees, all terms are available on this website.

## How do I request a commission?
- Join <a href="https://discord.gg/m8NRt4X8Gf" target="_blank">NightmareXIV Discord server</a> and either create a ticket or DM me with a brief description of your plugin idea.
- If you do not have access to Discord, please <a href="https://github.com/NightmareXIV/MyDalamudPlugins/issues" target="_blank">open an issue here</a> and provide alternative methods of contact.

## How much does it cost? How can I pay for it?
- The minimum price is **60 USD**;
- Most plugins end up in the range of **200 USD to 450 USD**;
- Contact me via Discord if you want to get an exact offer;

<a href="/docs/payments.html">Read about supported payment methods and how to keep the cost of the plugin low here.</a>

## How long will it take?
- General rule of thumb - 1 week for every 100 USD valued;
- Contact me via Discord if you would like to receive an exact quote with price and time estimate;

<a href="/docs/time.html">Read more about development time and possible development pauses here.</a>

## What about updating the plugin? 
- I provide one year of free updates for the plugin in case it is broken due to a game or Dalamud update. 
- After that, it will be no more than 10% of the total cost of the plugin per update. 
- You can subscribe to Total Nightmare or higher tier on my Patreon for free perpetual updates.

<a href="/docs/updates.html">Read more about the plugin update policy here.</a>

## How can I distribute plugin?
You can:
- Distribute plugin publicly;
- Distribute plugin privately to your friends or keep it for yourself;
- Send it to the official Dalamud repo or ask me to do so;
- Ask me to add it to the NightmareXIV repo.

<a href="/docs/distribution.html">Read more about distribution here.</a>

## Additional free and paid services
- Additional free and paid services you can request with the plugin are <a href="/docs/additional.html">listed on this page</a>. 

## Not a plugin
Besides plugin commissions, I can also offer the following services:
- Development of any standalone desktop or server .NET application;
- Implementing a feature in one of the NightmareXIV plugins;
- Modification of an existing plugin (if it's license allows it).

<a href="/docs/additional.html">Read more about additional services here.</a>

## Commercial use
Normally, you cannot use commissioned work commercially. This means:
- Directly or indirectly sell the plugin itself for real money;
- Using the plugin to earn real money.

However, a commercial agreement is available. <a href="/docs/commercial.html">Read more about the commercial agreement here.</a>
